  ### Question 1:
  
  ##### (a) (1 pt) Assume diastolic blood pressure is normally distributed in a certain population, with a mean of 82 mmHg and a standard deviation 11 mmHg. What proportion of this population has a diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg (i.e., what is the probability that a person in this population has a diastolic blood pressure less than 60)?
  
  ```{R}
#finding probability (area under curve) to the left of 60 mmHg on a normal curve
pnorm(60 , mean = 82, sd = 11)
```

*The proportion of people that have a diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg is 0.02275013.*
  
  ##### (b) (1 pt) What diastolic blood pressure would put an individual from this population at the 98th percentile?
  
  ```{R}
# finding diastolic blood pressure at the 98th percentile
qnorm(.98, mean = 82, sd = 11)
```

*The diastolic blood pressure for the 98th percentile is 104.5912 mmHg.*
  
  ##### (c) (1 pt) What is the probability that a random individual from this population will have a diastolic blood pressure higher than 100? (Equivalently, what proportion of the population has a diastolic BP greater than 100 mmHg?)
  
  ```{R}
# finding probability under 100 and subtracting it from 1 to find probability higher than 100
1-pnorm(100 , mean = 82, sd = 11)

```

*The proportion of people that have a diastolic blood pressure higher than 100 mmHg is 0.05088175.*
  
  
  ##### (d) (1 pt) What proportion of the population has a diastolic blood pressure bewteen 80 and 90?
  
  ```{R}
# finding proportion of under 90 and subtracting proportion of under 80 from it
pnorm(90, mean = 82, sd = 11) - pnorm (80, mean = 82, sd = 11)
```

*The proportion of people that have a diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 80 mmHg is 0.3386078*
  
  ##### (e) (1 pt) Assume this is the distribution of diastolic blood pressure for a healthy population. If we observe an individual from an unknown population with a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg, what is the probability of observing an individual with a BP this extreme (i.e., in *either direction of the mean*) if the individual really came from a normal population with a mean of 82 and standard deviation of 11?
  
  ```{R}
# Finding proportion above 110 mmHg and multiplying it by 2 to get the full proportion of this extreme
(1-pnorm(110 ,mean = 82 , sd = 11)) * 2
```

*The proportion of people that have a diastolic blood pressure as or more extreme than 110 mmHg is 0.01091356*
  
  
  ### Question 2
  
  Now, set the seed to 348 with `set.seed()`. Then, with `rnorm` take a sample of size 10,000 from a normal distribution with a mean of 82 and a standard deviation of 11.

##### (a) (3 pts) Using sum() on a logical vector, how many draws are less than 60? Using mean() on a logical vector, what proportion of the total draws is that? How far is your answer from pnorm() in 1.1 above?


```{R}
set.seed(348)
sample <- rnorm(10000, mean = 82, sd = 11)
sum(sample < 60)
mean(sample < 60)
0.0229 - 0.02275013
```

*229 draws are less than 60 and makess up a proportion of 0.0229 of the total draws. The difference from the pnorm in question 0.00014987.*
  
  ##### (b) (2 pts) What proportion of your sample is greater than 110 or less than 54?
  
  ```{R}
(sum(sample < 54) + sum(sample > 110))/10000
```

*The proportion of the sample that is greater than 110 or less than 54 is 0.0106.*
  
  ##### (c) (2 pts) Why are your answers close to what you got above? Why are they not exactly the same?
  
  *The answer for Question 1 part e (0.01091356) is similar to the answer for Question 2 part b 0.012 because both find the proportion greater than 110 mmHg or less than 54 mmHg in populations that have a mean of 82 mmHg and sd of 11 mmHg. The reason why they are slightly different is because in question 2 we work with a random sample of 10000 while in question 1 we assume it is from an infinite draw.*

  ##### (d) (3 pts) Using ggplot2, make a histogram of your sample. Set y=..density.. inside aes(). Overlay a normal distribution with +stat_function(aes(samp), fun=dnorm, args=list(82,11)). Using geom_vline(xintercept=), add dashed vertical lines corresponding to the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentile of the sample
  
  ```{R}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(sample)) + geom_histogram(aes(sample, y = ..density..)) + stat_function(aes(sample), fun = dnorm, args = list(82, 11)) + geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(sample, c(0.025, 0.975)), linetype = "dashed", color = "blue")
```
